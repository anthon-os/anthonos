### /etc/yp.conf file autogenerated by netconfig!
#
# Before you change this file manually, consider to define the
# static NIS configuration using the following variables in the
# /etc/sysconfig/network/config file:
#     NETCONFIG_NIS_STATIC_DOMAIN[_<number>]
#     NETCONFIG_NIS_STATIC_SERVERS[_<number>]
# or disable NIS configuration updates via netconfig by setting:
#     NETCONFIG_NIS_POLICY=''
#
# See also the netconfig(8) manual page and other documentation.
#
# Note: Manual change of this file disables netconfig too, but
# may get lost when this file contains comments or empty lines
# only, the netconfig settings are same with settings in this
# file and in case of a "netconfig update -f" call.
#
### Please remove (at least) this line when you modify the file!
