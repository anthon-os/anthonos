# Prototype Mailcap file
# Note that support for text & multipart are "built in" to metamail,
# as are rudimentary support for message, and application.
# However, any of these may be overridden in mailcap.
#
# Note that users may override or extend this with a .mailcap
# file in their own directory.  However, there is NO NEED
# for them to copy entries from this file, as metamail will
# pick up entries from both the system and personal mailcap files.
#

# NOTE:  This file has been heavily modified for use as an example
#        configuration file for Lynx

# In the samples given   test=test -n "$DISPLAY"   is used to
# determine if the current session is X capible by checking
# for the existance of a DISPLAY environment variable.
#
# any system (VMS included) without the DISPLAY environment variable
# will be assumed to be Non-X

# The following line is for sites where xv understands jpeg but xloadimage 
# is preferred.
#
# the test line specifies that this viewer should only be used if
# the display variable is set.
image/jpeg; display %s;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

# The following sends all other image subtypes to xloadimage
#image/*; xloadimage %s; ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

# The following sends all other image subtypes to xv
image/*; display %s; ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"


# If you have an interactive Postscript interpreter, you should think carefully 
# before replacing lpr with it in the following line, because PostScript
# can be an enormous security hole.  It is RELATIVELY harmless
# when sent to the printer...

# This one is for NON-X
#application/postscript ; lpr %s \; echo SENT FILE TO PRINTER; ;test=test -z "$DISPLAY"

# This one is for X
#application/postscript ; ghostview %s; ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

# The following should be commented out if you do NOT have safe-tcl
# and should be uncommented if you DO have safe-tcl

# A common problem with the mailcap mechanism is getting differential 
# behavior from different programs.  This problem is compounded by the fact 
# that some programs, notably Mosaic, do not implement the "test" clause in 
# mailcap files.  If you are using Lynx and X Mosaic together you should
# place all X-centric entries before non-X entries.  X Mosaic will use
# whichever entry is defined first so further entries will be ignored.
#
# Lynx exports the environment variable LYNX_VERSION, so if you wish
# to test if Lynx is running or not you can use 'test -n "LYNX_VERSION"'
