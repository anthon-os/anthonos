# once and then exits. "auto" is the default behaviour which means that
# the service is started as daemon.

# Interrupt that don't get balanced as list (separation character doesn't
# matter). For example broken chipsets don't allow the timer interrupt
# to be set to another CPU than the first, and with this option that
# policy can be applied.
