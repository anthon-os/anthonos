# Xservers - local X-server list
#
# This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
# local display; if you have more than one display (not screen),
# you can add entries to the list (one per line).
# If you also have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
# you can add them here as well; you will want to leave those terminals
# on and connected to the network, else kdm will have a tougher time
# managing them. Each X terminal line should look like:
#       XTerminalName:0 foreign
#

# use such a line to enable the console login option in the kdm menu
#:0 local@tty1 /usr/bin/X vt7
# "reserve" means that the X server gets only started on request (only kdm)
