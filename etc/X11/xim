# usually, /etc/X11/xim is used to start a default input method.

# If want to change the default, you have the following options:
#
#    1) Set the variable INPUT_METHOD in /etc/sysconfig/language.
#       For example:
#           INPUT_METHOD="scim"
#       This changes the default for all users
#    2) set and export the variable "INPUT_METHOD" in ~/.profile in the
#       home directory of a user (or ~/.login for csh users) For example:
#           export INPUT_METHOD="scim"
#       This changes the default only for one user.
#    
#    The possible values for the variable INPUT_METHOD are the names
#    of the scripts which exist in the directory /etc/X11/xim.d/
#    for example if a script /etc/X11/xim.d/scim exists,
#    and INPUT_METHOD is set to "scim", this script will be tried first
#    to start an input method and only if this fails other input methods
#    will be tried.
#
#    3) If you don't like the behaviour of any of the available
#       scripts in /etc/X11/xim.d, you can write your own script
#       containing the necessary lines to start your preferred input
#       method and save it as ~/.xim. If a file ~/.xim exists, only
#       this file is sourced to start an input method and nothing
#       else.
#       Usually you need only a few lines, the systemwide
#       file to start an input method, /etc/X11/xim, is only so
#       complicated because it tries to find a nice default depending
#       on the language and the installed input methods.
# 
#       For example, if you want to use "scim" as your input method,
#       it is enough to have the following 5 lines (and nothing else)
#       in your ~/.xim file:

#       export XMODIFIERS="@im=SCIM"
#       export GTK_IM_MODULE=scim
#       export QT_IM_SWITCHER=imsw-multi
#       export QT_IM_MODULE=scim
#       scim -d 

echo "/etc/X11/xim: Checking whether an input method should be started."

#
# Get variables from the user environment which might influence the start
# of an input method (see bug #235044, written by Werner Fink <werner@suse.de>):
